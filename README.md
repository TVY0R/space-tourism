## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Responsive workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite) - Styling

### What I learned

I learnt to work with the new tailwind styling which uses just the @import "tailwindcss";
in your .css and not the former @tailwind base (Nothing was working till i figured this was the problem as my styling were not rendering).

### Continued development

I'd like to focus on building completely responsive projects.
